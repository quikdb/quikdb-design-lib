### Additional Notes

- **Permissions:** If you encounter permission issues while installing globally, you might need to use `sudo` (for Unix-based systems) or run your terminal as an administrator (for Windows). For example:

  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that your system's PATH includes the directory where global `npm` or `yarn` packages are installed. This is typically handled automatically, but if you encounter issues accessing the `quikdb` command, you may need to adjust your PATH manually.

- **Updating the SDK:** To update the QuikDB SDK to the latest version, you can run:

  ```bash
  npm update -g quikdb-cli-beta
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn global upgrade quikdb-cli-beta
  ```
